    <string name="intro">This app is an example of Dependency Injection with Dependant Components.
        There is a parent - child relationship in between components.\n
        \u2022The parent component provides certain objects common to all the app.\n
        \u2022The child component provides objects specific for the activity.\n
        This is Dependant Components example, rather than Subcomponent example which is something else.
